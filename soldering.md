Soldering
=========

You need a temperature controlled soldering iron, i.e. don't not something like this use US$23 iron from Adafruit: <https://www.adafruit.com/product/180>

For more on why and more on soldering practice boards and how to solder, see JB's [Most FPV pilots need to watch this soldering tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoPT69y98pY).

I'd recommend:

* [Hakko FX-888D](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1204) US$130 from Adafruit
* [Weller WE1010](https://www.reichelt.com/ch/de/loetstation-we-1010-70-w-1-kanal-esd-weller-we1010-p218804.html) EUR 150 (or [here](https://www.conrad.de/de/p/weller-we-1010-230v-f-g-loetstation-digital-70-w-100-450-c-1664390.html) from Conrad).

The FX-888D is an iconic iron - you see it so many YouTube maker videos - but can be hard to source in the EU - the Weller is very similar and easy to find in the EU.

Always buy the FX-888D from a store like Adafruit - platforms like eBay, AliExpress and Amazon Marketplace have been flooded with Hakko fakes.

Soldering irons only support one input voltage, i.e. US 120V or EU 220V, so don't buy from the US if you're in the EU or vice-versa.

Unlike many other electronic devices thesse days, soldering irons are generally either 120V

Both the Hakko and the Weller come with 1.6mm screwdriver tips. You probably also want at least a 2.4mm screwdriver tip. I also have a 1.2mm for really small pads and a 3.2mm one for really large pads.

Other equipment
---------------

Basics:

* [Solder spool - 60/40 lead rosin-core](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1886) - US$8
* [Brass sponge solder tip cleaner](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1172) - US$11
* [Tip cleaning paste](https://www.ifixit.com/products/tip-cleaning-paste-hakko-fs100-01) - US$15
* [Solder sucker](https://www.adafruit.com/product/148) - US$5
* [Multi-size wire stripper & cutter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/147) - US$7
* [Flush diagonal cutters](https://www.adafruit.com/product/152) - US$7
* [Simple pliers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/146) - US$3
* [Digital Multimeter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2304) - US$18

Some people prefer [solder wick](https://www.adafruit.com/product/149) - US$3 - to a solder sucker. I just find the solder sucker much easier to use.

A flux pen is also a great help - especially for larger pads. There are restrictions on shipping flux pens (due to their chemical composition) so, in the US, the [Kester 2331-ZX](https://www.kester.com/products/product/2331-zx-flux-pen) is a popular hobbyist pen and in the EU, the equivalent is the [Stannol X32-10i](https://www.reichelt.com/ch/en/stannol-flux-pen-x32-10i-10-ml-stannol-x32-10i-p96335.html).

The multimeter above is a very basic model, I'd recommend an auto-ranging model - I have an Extech EX330 (US$60).

A popular Chinese multimeter brand is UNI-T, they're UT61B+ model has been extremely popular. More recently they've released the [UT161 series](https://meters.uni-trend.com/product/ut161-series/) which they describe the upgrade of the series that includes the UT61B+. Both the older UT61+ series and the UT161 series include three models, the basic B model and the D and E models that add temperature measurement and transistor hFE measurement respectively.

UNI-T models are available from various almost identical looking stores on AliExpress, e.g. [UNI-T Official Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/3095007), [UNI-T Direct Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/911121170) and [UNI-T Factory Store](https://uni-tchina.aliexpress.com/store/911012031). The [UNI-T site](https://meters.uni-trend.com/) doesn't endorse any specific AliExpress store.

However, at the moment only the UNI-T Official Store has the newer [UT161 series models](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002717433552.html) (and, if looking at the older series on the other stores, make sure that you're looking at UT61+ models and not UT61 and ignore claims that UT61+ and UT161 are the same - the UNI-T site clearly lists them as separate series).

Reichelt sells the [UT161B](https://www.reichelt.com/ch/de/multimeter-digital-6000-counts-usb-ut-161b-p302786.html) for only maginally more than the price on AliExpress. They also have the UT161D for EUR10 more and the UT161 for EUR30 more.

Nice to have:

* [Panavise Jr.](https://www.adafruit.com/product/151) - US$40
* [Helping Hands (Panavise compatible)](https://www.quadhands.com/collections/all/products/quadhands-base) - US$40
* [Fine tip curved tweezers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/422) - US$4
* [Smoke extractor](https://www.reichelt.nl/ch/de/loetrauchabsaugung-st-1016-16-w-las-st-1016-p291900.html) - US$40

The Panavise, Helping Hands and tweezers are all a great help when you need to hold things in place while soldering.

Note: most smoke extractors sold on AliExpress seem to be useless in reviews. I just open a window and make sure the room is well aired (turn on a fan).

Some people like a helping hands style of device that uses rods and screws (and typically a magnifying glass) like this [one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/291) (US$7) but I find they tend to be very fidlly and one bit or another sags no matter how you tighten things.

If you don't have 20/20 vision, an LED magnifying lamp (like this [5 diopter 177m glass lens one](https://www.reichelt.com/ch/en/magnifying-lamp-led-177-mm-real-glass-lens-5-diopters-dimm-lumeno-8245pro-p309517.html) from Lumeno - EUR 115) can be a great help - but a good one isn't cheap.

Wire and heat shrink tubing:

* [Hook-up wire - 22AWG solid core](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1311) - US$16 - for electronics projects.
* [Stranded silicon coated 14AWG, 18AWG and 26AWG wire](https://www.getfpv.com/accessories/wire/ethix-quad-builder-cable-set.html) - US$18 - for drone development.
* [2mm to 12mm diameter heat shrink tubing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4559) - US$10

Chose the right wire for the job - for drone development, you want stranded silicon coated wire and you want the right AWG, e.g. 14AWG for connecting batteries, 26AWG for connecting an RX to an FC.

You can shrink heat shrink tubing with a cigarette lighter but a hotair gun is more convenient - e.g. this [**US 120V** one from GetFPV](https://www.getfpv.com/110v-300w-portable-mini-heat-gun-tool-hot-air-gun.html) or you can find the same model for half the price on AliExpress, e.g. [here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2039618075.html) for **EU 220V**. Hotair guns are far larger than you might expect - they're about the same size as a hair dryer.

GetFPV
------

Many of the above links are to the Adafruit store. Here are similar items from GetFPV:

* [Leaded solder](https://www.getfpv.com/lumenier-100g-63-37-0-8mm-solder-wire.html)
* [Brass sponge solder tip cleaner](https://www.getfpv.com/accessories-390/tools/soldering-tip-cleaner-coiled-wire-ball-w-holder.html)
* [Tip cleaning paste](https://www.getfpv.com/accessories-390/tools/soldering-iron-tip-reviving-tinner-cleaner.html)
* [2mm to 13mm diameter heat shrink tubing](https://www.getfpv.com/heat-shrink-tube-assortment-box-508pcs-black.html) - this seems slightly over-priced and it's a shame there aren't both red and black colors.
