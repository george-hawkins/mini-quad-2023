Really, almost everyone says do time in a simulator. And Liftoff is the one that comes up again and again.

I found Liftoff's tutorial section fairly unsatisfactory. I'd have liked to be able to use their tutorial tracks without the constant interuption as you're pushed thru the whole process. And I read one of the Liftoff author's say that it's an area in which they didn't invest a lot of time after initial development.

Niklas Christl - [Learning To Fly The DJI FPV DRONE! (From Zero)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8nez1VtTk) - it doesn't teach you anything but it's very motivational - you see him going from being depressed at the initial experience and finding it very hard, to spending time practicing in Liftoff, initially using DJI's easier modes before shifting to full manual and becoming comfortable with that.

Ed Ricker - [How to Fly an FPV Quad - First Flight Tutorial and Beginner's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-3BvdjGsVw) - very nice first real flight video, taking things very slowly. Talks about applying yaw and roll together to keep horizon flat. Mentions cutting power (with your kill switch) just before landing so the propellers aren't still going when you hit the ground (resulting in you bouncing and chewing grass).

Matt Pochwat - [Learning FPV Drone Freestyle (In One Week!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlCgarOgtiY) - initially, I thought this was pointless as Matt clearly could already fly manual quite well. But around the 4 minute mark it gets more interesting - he talks about getting stuck just getting better and better at the basic movements without an obvious path to doing more interesting movements. He then walks us through his progress through Rotor Riot's [FPV Freestyle Tricktionary!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6RX8iI6gcQ) (their dictionary of FPV tricks), starting with the most basic and working his way through them over the course of a week (doing about 30 minutes of practice a day).

The RCAddict:

* [How to fly Line Of Sight : Acro Tutorial Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSaPPGa626c) - he recommends solid brightly colored props (he has mauve/pink on the front and cyan/blue on the back and also suggests yellow and white, he specifically says to avoid dark colors (e.g. dark blue or black) and clear). In acro, returning the stick to the center doesn't cancel out your movement, you have to go thru center and do the opposite motion to cancel out. Have a switch to flip you into auto-level mode when you panic. This was the first video where I tried out what he described in Liftoff - carefully moving side to side and forward and back. About 8m 45s into the video, he starts getting into the initial interesting steps beyond just getting off the ground - **practice** these.

RCAddict is best so far.

TheTomJon: [Top 9 Drills So You Can LEARN TO FLY Acro Flight Quickly!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_leCyI78Ng) - clear drills to follow to perfect different skills, his is the first video, I saw, where someone tries to clearly explain the need to combine yaw and roll to turn - if you're flat you can turn just with yaw, if you _could_ pitch forward 90&deg; (I facing straight down), you could turn with just roll - but generally you're at something like 30&deg; and need to combine yaw and roll to turn - at the 4m 28s mark he explains how people get this wrong (always good to be clear about the wrong way to do things) and then goes thru keeping your horizon flat with more yaw or roll depending on how pitched forward you are. Hovering, is a late exercise - rather than being the basic first step (as I imagined), video after video describes it as a hard skill to master. Steps 1 to 7 are the fundamentals - and step 7 will (he says) already involve a month of daily practice.

So far: get good on RCAddict basics (and take a look at his second video), then get onto TheTomJon's drills.

NEXT see if there's much to got out of JB / Rotor Riot's take on things.

Pascal Basel - [HOW TO START FPV / Beginners Guide & My FPV Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STE6Qp14FT4) - another inspirational one, reassures you that normal people can master this kind of thing. Although, the fact that he starts off with a Cinewhoop and crashes that many times before moving onto a 5" quad isn't so reassuring.

Joshua Bardwell - [Can Velocidrone make me a better drone racer | SIMULATOR VS REAL LIFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hiRUwtKC_Y) - of no use for learning but interesting to see how much value professional pilots think simulators offer - the race pilots are regularly using Velocidrone and competing against each other and analysing their moves. It's come up repeatedly that Velocidrone is perhaps less beginner friendly and less graphically acomplished (which actually makes it better for running on lower-spec machines) than Liftoff but a much more accurate simulator. It's also interesting to here that JB dials his max rate to 400 for racing, i.e. lower than is often recommended for beginner non-race pilots.

Liftoff - [Liftoff tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFeUttykY7A&list=PLfWQBJehRTHpT9UsbppgsRsxClFCkxvEa) - I think this is fairly disappointing - I'd rate it very low compared to the other videos here. These videos are very short and basic. They're six years old (as of mid-'23) and it uses tracks that I haven't been able to find in current game - the nearest one (with marked out areas for practicing controlled flying over clear targets etc.) are in the Liftoff game's tutorial section but rather than the abstract 3D space seen in the videos, the in-game one is in a more realistic practice space (not a problem) but you're not free to use them as you want - you have to go thru the fairly tiresome step-wise tutorial process. The in-game tutorial takes place on the track called _The Green_ but if you choose this track outside the tutorial, you won't find the tutorial's practice targets and gates.

Illuminate Drones Light Shows - if Liftoff's setup was slightly more intuitive, I wouldn't suggest these videos, but it's odd enough that these bite size videos may be helpful:

* [Calibrate controller in Liftoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHBU-1381f4)
* [Assign buttons to controller in Liftoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYyaz4h16sM)
* [Learning acro (manual) mode in Liftoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGIkdQQqOiA) - brief discussion of using artificial horizon with yaw and roll.

UAVfutures - this "How to fly a fpv race drone" series is very bite sized (2 or 3 mins per lesson), so there's not much depth here:

* [Lesson 1 Hovering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmZ8yDqFfc)
* [Lesson 2 Basic turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgheJzA1WfQ)
* [Lesson 3 First rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNfznGQU39c)
* [Lesson 4 hairpins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uECmB-lwtPA)
* [Lesson 5 powerloops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooXDVRuI8TQ)

Having said there's not much depth, I did find watching them useful after overcoming my initial inability to do anything - I reached a point where I could career around wildly and it was good to be encouraged to just bob up and down in a controlled manner and then try to maintain a constant height while manoeuvering (rather than screaching skyward and plunging back).

FPV Academy originally did this series back in February 2016 and then did an updated version in May 2017. For whatever reason, the YouTube algorithm often suggests the original videos rather than the updated versions. The videos are well made - it does look like the intention was for the series to run longer but it just stops at lesson 6 with no explanation as to why they didn't go further. The gates and flags that he practices with and links to in his video descriptions stopped being available long ago.

You can find versions of the tracks used for the lessons and drills by going to Days of Adventure's [Liftoff Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/id/daysofadventure/myworkshopfiles/?appid=410340), open each of the items in turn and click _Subscribe_ for each.

Then, in Steam:

* Go to your name (that shows to the right of _STORE LIBRARY COMMUNITY_ at the top of the main Steam window).
* Select _Profile_ (from the dropdown that's shown if you hover over your name) and then select _Workshop Items_ in the panel on the right.
* Select _Subscribed Items_ from the panel on the lower right.

Here you'll see the items you've subscribed for. If you now open Liftoff, select _Free Flight_, scroll to right to the final environment called _The Drawing Board_, you should then be able to select one of the tracks that you've subscribed to. When asked to _Select Spawn Point_, always select _Custom 1_ rather than _Default_.

I didn't have any issues with the tracks but some people say they have and a user called Aravis has recreated them as a [map pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1288762898). This has the advantage that you can subscribe to them all with a single click. I haven't tried these versions of the maps.

As with many of these videos, my initial feeling was "you're not telling me how to stop bobbing around like a lunatic" but the real answer to that is just an immense amount of practice. I grew to like the style of these videos. And it was watching the stick movements shown in these videos that I realized you should always be returning to center (for pitch, roll and yaw) almost immediately - even though I'd heard it explained many times that you need to reverse your movement to complete a manoeuver, it still wasn't clear to me if you should return to center as part of reversing your movement at the end of the manoeuver or almost immediately after making any given movement - the answer seems to be the latter. Just watch how his sticks only ever momentarily move away center before returning straight away. So, always quickly let the sticks bounce back to the center - that's what the springs are there to do.
