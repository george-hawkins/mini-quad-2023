Really, almost everyone says do time in a simulator. And Liftoff is the one that comes up again and again.

Niklas Christl - [Learning To Fly The DJI FPV DRONE! (From Zero)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb8nez1VtTk) - it doesn't teach you anything but it's very motivational - you see him going from being depressed at the initial experience and finding it very hard, to spending time practicing in Liftoff, initially using DJI's easier modes before shifting to full manual and becoming comfortable with that.

Ed Ricker - [How to Fly an FPV Quad - First Flight Tutorial and Beginner's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-3BvdjGsVw) - very nice first real flight video, taking things very slowly. Talks about applying yaw and roll together to keep horizon flat. Mentions cutting power (with your kill switch) just before landing so the propellers aren't still going when you hit the ground (resulting in you bouncing and chewing grass).

Matt Pochwat - [Learning FPV Drone Freestyle (In One Week!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlCgarOgtiY) - initially, I thought this was pointless as Matt clearly could already fly manual quite well. But around the 4 minute mark it gets more interesting - he talks about getting stuck just getting better and better at the basic movements without an obvious path to doing more interesting movements. He then walks us through his progress through Rotor Riot's [FPV Freestyle Tricktionary!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6RX8iI6gcQ) (their dictionary of FPV tricks), starting with the most basic and working his way through them over the course of a week (doing about 30 minutes of practice a day).

The RCAddict:

* [How to fly Line Of Sight : Acro Tutorial Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSaPPGa626c) - he recommends solid brightly colored props (he has mauve/pink on the front and cyan/blue on the back and also suggests yellow and white, he specifically says to avoid dark colors (e.g. dark blue or black) and clear). In acro, returning the stick to the center doesn't cancel out your movement, you have to go thru center and do the opposite motion to cancel out. Have a switch to flip you into auto-level mode when you panic. This was the first video where I tried out what he described in Liftoff - carefully moving side to side and forward and back. About 8m 45s into the video, he starts getting into the initial interesting steps beyond just getting off the ground - **practice** these.

RCAddict is best so far.

TheTomJon: [Top 9 Drills So You Can LEARN TO FLY Acro Flight Quickly!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_leCyI78Ng) - clear drills to follow to perfect different skills, his is the first video, I saw, where someone tries to clearly explain the need to combine yaw and roll to turn - if you're flat you can turn just with yaw, if you _could_ pitch forward 90&deg; (I facing straight down), you could turn with just roll - but generally you're at something like 30&deg; and need to combine yaw and roll to turn - at the 4m 28s mark he explains how people get this wrong (always good to be clear about the wrong way to do things) and then goes thru keeping your horizon flat with more yaw or roll depending on how pitched forward you are. Hovering, is a late exercise - rather than being the basic first step (as I imagined), video after video describes it as a hard skill to master. Steps 1 to 7 are the fundamentals - and step 7 will (he says) already involve a month of daily practice.

So far: get good on RCAddict basics (and take a look at his second video), then get onto TheTomJon's drills.

NEXT see if there's much to got out of JB / Rotor Riot's take on things.

Pascal Basel - [HOW TO START FPV / Beginners Guide & My FPV Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STE6Qp14FT4) - another inspirational one, reassures you that normal people can master this kind of thing. Although, the fact that he starts off with a Cinewhoop and crashes that many times before moving onto a 5" quad isn't so reassuring.
