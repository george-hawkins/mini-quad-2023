There's no instruction manual either online or with the frame fro the QAV-R 2 DC.

DrainMan FPV build of non-DC variant - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npAWcTUKCpU>

At 8m 47s, he refers to the the two sets of slots at the back of the upper plate as zip-tie holes for the antenna.

Slots for camera mark front of bottom plate.

Lock nuts face into body of quad.

The M3x8mm 28pcs are for motors.

M3x30mm are for the center stack.

The M3x14mm are for the places where there are stadoffs.

And the M3x12mm are for where there aren't stadoffs.

More detailed build from SF PV - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcpguW2v5es>

He notes the middle screw is different from all the others but the DC doesn't seem to come with a one off special screw.

He uses race wire - see README.

Mr. Steele uses wire protectors (see 46m 18s in video below) which looks simpler. And he attaches them with two wraps of electrical tape.

He trims off 2mm from ends of motor wires before attaching to ESC.

Tape over ESC with Kapton tape.

Actual builds the DC variant.

He says the odd little plastic pieces are for mounting micro cameras if you don't want to use the carbon fiber side plates. And indeed you can find lots of images of this style of mounting:

![micr camera mount](https://files.cults3d.com/uploaders/6148699/illustration-file/ec66db2d-3b8c-4e69-aa17-65d9d97e0d37/IMG_20190325_203111_1.jpg)

Oddly, his middle small X hsa different width arms (front two for front arms are narrower), but for mine all arms are the same width.

He just uses a "medium" screw (the 12mm, I guess) for the middle hole.

All the stadoffs just go thru one layer of carbon fiber - so, he only uses the longer (14mm) ones for the two standoffs at the back of the triple layers of carbon fiber.

He puts the rubber o-rings at the bottom of the stack bolts.

Mr. Steele - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17RaCAcFh4A>

At 32m 14s he cuts down the pigtail to 55mm.

Then he cuts the red 5mm shorter - he wants it to come out the right-hand side.

He pushes in an unreal amount of solder when tinning.

He uses neddle pliers rather than tweezers.

He only puts on stadoffs etc. once he's soldered up the ESC.

He puts an isolation plate beneath the VTX. But if you use metal screws this is a bit pointless (he uses nylon).

He sticks his RX to the top of his VTX - see notes on JB and Ummagawd doings this in README.

JB 2022 Freestyle FPV Drone Build:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T_JC4v5T3E&list=PLwoDb7WF6c8neIAQBkchfiXf-C8KbzG5M>

At the 2m 50s mark, he comments he uses Gemfan Hurricance 51477 fans - I got the 51466 variant - I don't know what the difference is.

If you look at JB's video, you can see the o-rings make sense if you ESC has short gummies but the Tekko have tall gummies.

He does reduce motor slack at the ESC end rather than the motor end due to fear of the cable being cut by the props.

Twisting cables to stop them splaying.

Rounting the XT60 pigtail at 90&deg; looks like your only option

Or you rotate the ESC 180&deg; - but you can't flip it upside down - otherwise you can't get at the ESC pads.

When putting in motor screws make sure screws don't push into motor body and make sure not to overtighten and strip aluminium threads of motor.

The motors come with their own screws for 3mm, 4mm and 5mm thick arms - my calipers says the arms aren't a consistent thickness - they vary between 4.55mm and 4.74mm.

But the cap on the opposite side of ESC to XT60 pigtain?
