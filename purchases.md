Where to buy
------------

In the US, you can many of the parts in one place: [GetFPV](https://www.getfpv.com/).

In Europe, there's no site with a similarly comprehensive range. Some of the parts used in this build, particularly those from Holybro, can be found at:

* UK - [Unmanned Tech](https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/)
* UK - [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/)
* DE - [Premium-Modellbau](https://www.premium-modellbau.de/)

Much smaller store, but also worth a mention is [Team Blacksheep](https://www.team-blacksheep.com/) (orders ship from China).

Even if based in Europe, I'd suggest buying from GetFPV and accepting the hefty postal fee and import duties. The import duties will depend on your particular country, the postal fee appear to be fixed - whether you buy one tiny cheap item or a whole basket of expensive items, GetFPV seems to charge around US$20 for their basic shipping or US$40 for shipping via DHL (they strongly recommend against basic shipping for international orders).

Even if you try and buy everything from GetFPV, at any given time, you'll find a surprising number of items marked as unavailable or on backorder. This appears to be an ongoing consequence of COVID even after most other signs of the pandemic have receded.

So, no matter what, you'll have to buy from multiple sources.

Many, if not all, of these products are produced by Chinese manufacturers. If you're not used to browsing the world of mid-size Chinese firms, you may find many of their sites oddly amateurish - I won't theorize as to why this is the case, it's simply a fact that they don't seem to view their own websites as an important window on their brands. Despite this, I've found shopping at these sites largely unproblematic.

A couple of things to note:

* Shipping from China typically takes two to three weeks (and much longer if you live in a country with an inefficient customs service).
* They tend to ship with minimal packaging - usually the lack of padding doesn't involve anything worse than cosmetic damage to an item's packaging but sometimes the item itself is damaged.

Here are some sites for specific brands:

* Radiomaster:
  * [Radiomaster Global](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/) - products are priced in USD or RMB and ship from China.
  * [Radiomaster EU](https://www.radiomasterrc.eu/) - products ship from the Netherlands but items are often out of stock (so, just go to the global store).

* Holybro:
  * [Holybro Global](https://holybro.com/)
  * [Holybro Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/brands-Holybro-b-976.html)

Banggood is a more structured version of AliExpress and somewhat less Wild West - from a customer's point of view everything comes from Banggood itself and there's no interaction with small Chinese suppliers. Banggood seems to have gone through a number of phases - early on it was viewed very negatively for selling knock-offs of more expensive brands, then many manufacturers, such as FrSky, started using it as their official storefront to the world. Now, though, my impression is that many of these manufacturers have moved to storefronts on AliExpress or moved away from selling directly and instead prefer to work through distributors.

* [CaddxFPV](https://caddxfpv.com/) (maker of the Walksnail system)

* [BetaFPV Global](https://betafpv.com/)

* FrSky:
  * FrSky [official AliExpress store](https://frsky.aliexpress.com/)
  * [HorusRC](https://www.horusrc.com/) - FrSky has a number of international distributors, HorusRC seems to be the largest one.

* EMAX [official AliExpress store](https://emax.aliexpress.com/)

AliExpress is an odd place. There's millions of tiny stores there (with reputations ranging from unknown to terrible to excellent) but there are also lots of stores that are the official storefront of major manufacturers. But you should always go to the manufacturers website and find if they link to a particular store on AliExpress - the fact that a random AliExpress store calls itself the "official store" for a particular brand doesn't mean anything in itself.

* Diatone:
  * [Diatone Global](https://www.diatone.us/)
  * Diatone [official AliExpress store](https://diatone.aliexpress.com/)

* GensACE:
  * [GensACE EU](https://www.gensace.de/)
  * [GensTattu US](https://www.genstattu.com/)

Shipping for Li-ion and LiPo batteries is extremelly controlled - they're a case where shipping across borders can be more trouble than it's worth - if you're living outside the US or a major European country, you may have no choice but to buy them from a local supplier.

* [ViFly Global](https://viflydrone.com/)

* [Ummagawd Global](https://ummagawd.com/) (manufacturer of Ummagrip products).

* [Flywoo Global](https://flywoo.net)

Small AliExpress stores:

* For HQProps:
  * [RusFPV](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/4219041)
  * [HobbyArrow](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/4394092)
* For Gemfan wrench: [FeiYing RC](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/3623124)

Despite it's Wild West reputation, I've had almost no problems with buying many items from small stores on AliExpress. But do be careful - I tend to stick with stores that have been open for several years and have already made at least a few sales of the item that I'm interested in. You can hover over the store name, to the right of the main AliExpress logo and see some stats and you can also see a count, beside the star rating (if any), for how many of given item that store has sold previously. Obviously, such metrics can be gained so don't treat them as any kind of guarantee. Once or twice, I've found items have failed to show up from AliExpress sellers - in these cases either the sellers themselves, AliExpress or my payment handler (I always use PayPal for these payments) has eventually refunded the money.

In one respect, I'd trust AliExpress more than the sites of even fairly large and reputable brands like Holybro - payment. Whatever else about AliExpress, they're huge and they're probably more capable of keeping your shipping and payment details secure than many other sites.

However, many of the Chinese sites are now powered by Shopify so, perhaps this provides a similar level of security.

I chose the Radiomaster Boxer over the TX16S MK II because I liked the less bulky size and while I like the large color touchscreen on the TX16S MK II, I don't believe I would use it enough for it to be a real plus. Also I like that the Boxer comes with case and gimbal protectors.

Note: once you have your goggles on the color touchscreen of the TX16S MK II makes no difference other than adding bulk to the TX. Most reviewers found the feel and size of the Boxer to be perfect. So, I think, the feel in the hand while flying is more important than any coolness and convenience that the touchscreen offers for essentially one time setup operations.

From www.radiomasterrc.com:

US$9 Radiomaster 2500mAh 18650 (2 pack)
US$140 Radiomaster Boxer ExpressLRS LBT (for the US, choose the FCC variant and for the EU, the LBT variant).

Just for comparison and because they're so cheap:
$3 Radiomaster 6cm 2.4GHz U.FL plain wire antenna (4 pack) - <https://www.radiomasterrc.com/collections/antenna/products/r81-receiver-replacement-antenna-4pcs>

Note: standard shipping was US$30 - that and import duties mean it buying locally would probably make more sense.

Import fees were: Fr. 27. And shipping took from May 20th to June 6th.

When the package arrived, it was clearly missing the labeling that's required to indicate that it contains li-ion batteries. Certain postal service will destroy packages that are found to contain li-ion batteries without being labeled correctly. I looked at the Radiomaster website and, on their [shipping page](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/pages/shipping-delivery), it says you must choose expedited shipping (which costs as additional US$15) for all orders that include li-ion batteries. However, they don't enforce this on checkout and when I selected normal shipping, they just carefully opened the shrink wrapped box containing the Boxer radio and hid the batteries inside.

Oddly, Holbro's main site and their official Banggood store had different availability on different things. So, I bought some things from one and some from the other.

Banggood:

SFr6.44 JHMCU Flight Controller Soldering Welding Practice Board for FPV Racing RC Drone
	
SFr5.52 XT60 Male Plug 12AWG 10cm With Wire

Note: the pigtails sold by GetFPV are also 12AWG but TBS sell them with much lighter 16AWG wire.
	
SFr25.77 HSKRC XL5 232mm Carbon Fiber FPV Racing Frame kit
	
SFr63.48 Holybro SiK Telemetry Radio V3 100mW 433MHz (for the US, choose the 915MHz variant and for the EU, the 433MHz variant).
	
SFr104.95 HOTA D6 Pro lipo charger (Black / EU plug)
	
SFr156.52 Holybro Kakute H7 V2 Flight Controller and Tekko32 F4 4in1 50A

**Update:** v2 of the Kakute H7 FC seems to have become very hard to source. Holybro's main site has even started selling the earlier v1.3. Banggood sent me an email to say they'd run out of stock for the FC and ESC combo deal (to be fair, they'd noted that there was only one left during the checkout process, I guess someone else got that first). So, I ordered the FC and ESC separately as there still seemed to be stock for each - buying them separately cost CHF16 more (and one doesn't get the nuts and bolts, needed to build the stack, that were included in the combo deal).

TODO: see what revisions you get of FC and ESC - the pictures show v2.1 for the FC and v1.5 for the ESC. Hopefully, the actual FC version is 2.2 and the ESC version is 1.9:

* [Kakute H7 version differences](https://docs.holybro.com/fpv-flight-controller/kakute-h7-version-difference).
* [ESC current sensor scale](https://docs.holybro.com/esc/current-sensor-scale).

**Important:** the _current sensor scale_ document makes clear that the ESC version dramatically effects the scale value, I assume this is the value, you should specify you the amperage meter settings (as described [here](https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/configurator/power-tab#amperage-meter) for Betaflight. I don't know what the equivalent setting is for ArduPilot.

Standard shipping total cost was: US$10.

Holybro main site:

US$2.60 battery strap - 20*200mm - 2 pieces.
US$52 Holybro M8N GPS
US$21 QAV250 kit

Standard shipping total cost was: US$8.

Note: I chose not to buy the US$25 more expensive M9N GPS module - but it's worth considering.

---

BetaFPV:

US$20 SuperD ELRS 2.4G Diversity Receiver

Standard shipping was US$10 - so, for such a low-value item, you're probably better off trying to source it locally.

Shipping took from May 29th to June 8th (came in a padded bag).

I bought my FrSky antennas from a small AliExpress supplier - [EasyScope RC Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/712819).

US$3.40 2 x FrSky 2.4GHz 80mm IPEX1 dipole antenna.
US$3.60 2 x FrSky 2.4GHz 150mm IPEX1 dipole antenna.

Standard shipping total was US$7.

I wanted to try the 80mm and 150mm lengths and this was the only AliExpress store, I could find selling all lengths (80/150/250mm lengths) of the better sleeved balun style antennas (with IPEX1 connector).

FrSky's AliExpress store only had the 80mm variant. And HorusRC would only sell antennas in packs of 10, so buying 10 of two different lengths (plus standard shipping of US$7 came to ~US$40 versus US$14 when buying two of each length from the EasyScope RC Store.

---

Emax official AliExpress store:

US$9 - motor clamping pliers.
US$62 - 4 x Emax ECO II 2207 2400KV (make sure to select the correct KV value).

Standard shipping was $US4.

Shipping took from May 29th to June 8th (came in small plastic wrapper with no bubblewrap - the boxes containing the motors include a little protective padding around the motors).

---

FeiYing RC AliExpress store:

US$4 HGLRC buzzer and WS2812 LED board.
US$5 Gemfan WL-06 8MM ratchet socket wrench.

Standard shipping was US$6

---

Team Blacksheep:

US$6 - Ethix Battery Straps (4pcs) - 250mm
US$6 - Ethix Battery Straps V2 (4pcs) - 230mm
US$4 - XT60 pigtail (16awg)

The Team Blacksheep web shop is extremely basic - e.g. there appears to be no account details page and no ability to see outstanding orders (but you do get a link in your confirmation email that allows you to see the status of your order).

I was interested to compare the feel of the 16AWG pigtail with the more usual 12AWG ones.

If I could have, I would have gotten these parts via GetFPV but they were unavailable or out of stock.
