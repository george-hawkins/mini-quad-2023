Where to buy
------------

In the US, you can many of the parts in one place: [GetFPV](https://www.getfpv.com/).

In Europe, there's no site with a similarly comprehensive range. Some of the parts used in this build, particularly those from Holybro, can be found at:

* UK - [Unmanned Tech](https://www.unmannedtechshop.co.uk/)
* UK - [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/)
* DE - [Premium-Modellbau](https://www.premium-modellbau.de/)

Much smaller store, but also worth a mention is [Team Blacksheep](https://www.team-blacksheep.com/) (orders ship from China).

Even if based in Europe, I'd suggest buying from GetFPV and accepting the hefty postal fee and import duties. The import duties will depend on your particular country, the postal fee appear to be fixed - whether you buy one tiny cheap item or a whole basket of expensive items, GetFPV seems to charge around US$20 for their basic shipping or US$40 for shipping via DHL (they strongly recommend against basic shipping for international orders).

Even if you try and buy everything from GetFPV, at any given time, you'll find a surprising number of items marked as unavailable or on backorder. This appears to be an ongoing consequence of COVID even after most other signs of the pandemic have receded.

So, no matter what, you'll have to buy from multiple sources.

Many, if not all, of these products are produced by Chinese manufacturers. If you're not used to browsing the world of mid-size Chinese firms, you may find many of their sites oddly amateurish - I won't theorize as to why this is the case, it's simply a fact that they don't seem to view their own websites as an important window on their brands. Despite this, I've found shopping at these sites largely unproblematic.

A couple of things to note:

* Shipping from China typically takes two to three weeks (and much longer if you live in a country with an inefficient customs service).
* They tend to ship with minimal packaging - usually the lack of padding doesn't involve anything worse than cosmetic damage to an item's packaging but sometimes the item itself is damaged.

Here are some sites for specific brands:

* Radiomaster:
  * [Radiomaster Global](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/) - products are priced in USD or RMB and ship from China.
  * [Radiomaster EU](https://www.radiomasterrc.eu/) - products ship from the Netherlands but items are often out of stock (so, just go to the global store).

* Holybro:
  * [Holybro Global](https://holybro.com/)
  * [Holybro Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/brands-Holybro-b-976.html)

Banggood is a more structured version of AliExpress and somewhat less Wild West - from a customer's point of view everything comes from Banggood itself and there's no interaction with small Chinese suppliers. Banggood seems to have gone through a number of phases - early on it was viewed very negatively for selling knock-offs of more expensive brands, then many manufacturers, such as FrSky, started using it as their official storefront to the world. Now, though, my impression is that many of these manufacturers have moved to storefronts on AliExpress or moved away from selling directly and instead prefer to work through distributors.

* [CaddxFPV](https://caddxfpv.com/) (maker of the Walksnail system)

* [BetaFPV Global](https://betafpv.com/)

* FrSky:
  * FrSky [official AliExpress store](https://frsky.aliexpress.com/)
  * [HorusRC](https://www.horusrc.com/) - FrSky has a number of international distributors, HorusRC seems to be the largest one.

* EMAX [official AliExpress store](https://emax.aliexpress.com/)

AliExpress is an odd place. There's millions of tiny stores there (with reputations ranging from unknown to terrible to excellent) but there are also lots of stores that are the official storefront of major manufacturers. But you should always go to the manufacturers website and find if they link to a particular store on AliExpress - the fact that a random AliExpress store calls itself the "official store" for a particular brand doesn't mean anything in itself.

* Diatone:
  * [Diatone Global](https://www.diatone.us/)
  * Diatone [official AliExpress store](https://diatone.aliexpress.com/)

* GensACE:
  * [GensACE EU](https://www.gensace.de/)
  * [GensTattu US](https://www.genstattu.com/)

Shipping for Li-ion and LiPo batteries is extremelly controlled - they're a case where shipping across borders can be more trouble than it's worth - if you're living outside the US or a major European country, you may have no choice but to buy them from a local supplier.

* [ViFly Global](https://viflydrone.com/)

* [Ummagawd Global](https://ummagawd.com/) (manufacturer of Ummagrip products).

* [Flywoo Global](https://flywoo.net)

Small AliExpress stores:

* For HQProps:
  * [RusFPV](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/4219041)
  * [HobbyArrow](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/4394092)
* For Gemfan wrench: [FeiYing RC](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/3623124)

Despite it's Wild West reputation, I've had almost no problems with buying many items from small stores on AliExpress. But do be careful - I tend to stick with stores that have been open for several years and have already made at least a few sales of the item that I'm interested in. You can hover over the store name, to the right of the main AliExpress logo and see some stats and you can also see a count, beside the star rating (if any), for how many of given item that store has sold previously. Obviously, such metrics can be gained so don't treat them as any kind of guarantee. Once or twice, I've found items have failed to show up from AliExpress sellers - in these cases either the sellers themselves, AliExpress or my payment handler (I always use PayPal for these payments) has eventually refunded the money.

In one respect, I'd trust AliExpress more than the sites of even fairly large and reputable brands like Holybro - payment. Whatever else about AliExpress, they're huge and they're probably more capable of keeping your shipping and payment details secure than many other sites.

However, many of the Chinese sites are now powered by Shopify so, perhaps this provides a similar level of security.

I chose the Radiomaster Boxer over the TX16S MK II because I liked the less bulky size and while I like the large color touchscreen on the TX16S MK II, I don't believe I would use it enough for it to be a real plus. Also I like that the Boxer comes with case and gimbal protectors.

Note: once you have your goggles on the color touchscreen of the TX16S MK II makes no difference other than adding bulk to the TX. Most reviewers found the feel and size of the Boxer to be perfect. So, I think, the feel in the hand while flying is more important than any coolness and convenience that the touchscreen offers for essentially one time setup operations.

From www.radiomasterrc.com:

US$9 Radiomaster 2500mAh 18650 (2 pack)
US$140 Radiomaster Boxer ExpressLRS LBT (for the US, choose the FCC variant and for the EU, the LBT variant).

Just for comparison and because they're so cheap:
$3 Radiomaster 6cm 2.4GHz U.FL plain wire antenna (4 pack) - <https://www.radiomasterrc.com/collections/antenna/products/r81-receiver-replacement-antenna-4pcs>

Note: standard shipping was US$30 - that and import duties mean it buying locally would probably make more sense.

Import fees were: Fr. 27. And shipping took from May 20th to June 6th.

It came in a carboard box just large enough to contain the box with the Boxer radio with no bubble wrap or other packing material.

When the package arrived, it was clearly missing the labeling that's required to indicate that it contains li-ion batteries. Certain postal service will destroy packages that are found to contain li-ion batteries without being labeled correctly. I looked at the Radiomaster website and, on their [shipping page](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/pages/shipping-delivery), it says you must choose expedited shipping (which costs as additional US$15) for all orders that include li-ion batteries. However, they don't enforce this on checkout and when I selected normal shipping, they just carefully opened the shrink wrapped box containing the Boxer radio and hid the batteries inside.

**Note:** while it comes with case and gimball protectors, it doesn't come with a neck strap so if doing again, I'd buy:

<https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/radiomaster-deluxe-neck-strap-adjustable-for-transmitter>

Oddly, Holbro's main site and their official Banggood store had different availability on different things. So, I bought some things from one and some from the other.

Banggood:

SFr6.44 JHMCU Flight Controller Soldering Welding Practice Board for FPV Racing RC Drone
	
SFr5.52 XT60 Male Plug 12AWG 10cm With Wire

Note: the pigtails sold by GetFPV are also 12AWG but TBS sell them with much lighter 16AWG wire.
	
SFr25.77 HSKRC XL5 232mm Carbon Fiber FPV Racing Frame kit
	
SFr63.48 Holybro SiK Telemetry Radio V3 100mW 433MHz (for the US, choose the 915MHz variant and for the EU, the 433MHz variant).
	
SFr104.95 HOTA D6 Pro lipo charger (Black / EU plug)
	
SFr156.52 Holybro Kakute H7 V2 Flight Controller and Tekko32 F4 4in1 50A

**Update:** v2 of the Kakute H7 FC seems to have become very hard to source. Holybro's main site has even started selling the earlier v1.3. Banggood sent me an email to say they'd run out of stock for the FC and ESC combo deal (to be fair, they'd noted that there was only one left during the checkout process, I guess someone else got that first). So, I ordered the FC and ESC separately as there still seemed to be stock for each - buying them separately cost CHF16 more (and one doesn't get the nuts and bolts, needed to build the stack, that were included in the combo deal).

TODO: see what revisions you get of FC and ESC - the pictures show v2.1 for the FC and v1.5 for the ESC. Hopefully, the actual FC version is 2.2 and the ESC version is 1.9:

The ESC version was 1.7 and the FC was version 2.1, i.e the original version with the 1.5A BEC rather than the 2.2 one with a 3A BEC.

* [Kakute H7 version differences](https://docs.holybro.com/fpv-flight-controller/kakute-h7-version-difference).
* [ESC current sensor scale](https://docs.holybro.com/esc/current-sensor-scale).

**Important:** the _current sensor scale_ document makes clear that the ESC version dramatically effects the scale value, I assume this is the value, you should specify you the amperage meter settings (as described [here](https://betaflight.com/docs/wiki/configurator/power-tab#amperage-meter) for Betaflight. I don't know what the equivalent setting is for ArduPilot.

Standard shipping total cost was: US$10.

The shipping for all of this order (except the ESC and FC) took from May 27th to June 16th.

Like a few of the other deliveries, it came it a simple thin plastic postage bag with no bubble wrap or other protective packaging. And they'd simple cellotaped the boxes containing the telelmetry radio, charger etc. together to stop things shifting around in the bag. The box containing the HSKRC XL5 frame had taken a bit of a bash but the contents seem OK.

The FC and ESC (despite being order two days later) arrived on the same day as the rest of the items, i.e. shipping took from May 29th to June 16th. While still being sent in a plastic postage bag, this items were wrapped in protective padding material (as well as the individual FC and ESC boxes themselves being well padded).

Note: I received many carbon fiber pieces, the pieces of HSKRC XL5 frame were the only such items that had not been cleaned (after the process of cutting them from a carbon fiber sheet) - this meant there was lots of carbon fiber dust. You should wash such items with soapy water and avoid inhaling the dust as it's harmful to your lungs.

Holybro main site:

US$2.60 battery strap - 20*200mm - 2 pieces.
US$52 Holybro M8N GPS
US$21 QAV250 kit

Standard shipping total cost was: US$8.

Note: I chose not to buy the US$25 more expensive M9N GPS module - but it's worth considering.

Shipping took from May 29th to June 13th. This was one of the few items that shipped from China that was packed to the standard you'd expect elsewhere, i.e. a proper cardboard box and enough bubble wrap etc.

**Update:** the QAV250 kit came with a pair of 20*200mm straps so, buying an additional pair was pointless.

The straps I bought were these ones: <https://holybro.com/products/strap20-200mm-battery-strap2pcs?_pos=1&_psq=strap&_ss=e&_v=1.0> - these ones and the ones in the kit have metal buckles unlike the plastic ones shown in the photo.

---

BetaFPV:

US$20 SuperD ELRS 2.4G Diversity Receiver

Standard shipping was US$10 - so, for such a low-value item, you're probably better off trying to source it locally.

Shipping took from May 29th to June 8th (came in a padded bag).

---

I bought my FrSky antennas from a small AliExpress supplier - [EasyScope RC Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/712819).

US$3.40 2 x FrSky 2.4GHz 80mm IPEX1 dipole antenna.
US$3.60 2 x FrSky 2.4GHz 150mm IPEX1 dipole antenna.

Standard shipping total was US$7.

I wanted to try the 80mm and 150mm lengths and this was the only AliExpress store, I could find selling all lengths (80/150/250mm lengths) of the better sleeved balun style antennas (with IPEX1 connector).

FrSky's AliExpress store only had the 80mm variant. And HorusRC would only sell antennas in packs of 10, so buying 10 of two different lengths (plus standard shipping of US$7 came to ~US$40 versus US$14 when buying two of each length from the EasyScope RC Store.

Shipping took from May 29th to June 17th and came in a padded bag.

---

Emax official AliExpress store:

US$9 - motor clamping pliers.
US$62 - 4 x Emax ECO II 2207 2400KV (make sure to select the correct KV value).

Standard shipping was $US4.

For the motors, shipping took from May 29th to June 8th (came in small plastic wrapper with no bubblewrap - the boxes containing the motors include a little protective padding around the motors).

For the clamp, shipping took from May 29th to June 17th. In an example of how random packing is from Chinese suppliers, both the motors and the clamp came from Emax but the motors came with essentially no addiational packaging while the clamp (that is clearly far more robust than the motors) came in a sturdy cardboard box containing a truly ridiculous amount protective padding material.

---

FeiYing RC AliExpress store:

US$4 HGLRC buzzer and WS2812 LED board.
US$5 Gemfan WL-06 8MM ratchet socket wrench.

Standard shipping was US$6

Shipping took from May 29th to June 16th - it came in a padded envelope and the items themselves were wrapped in additional bubble wrap.

PS if you're wondering what the rotatable red bit at the end of the handle is - you can also buy it with a screw head attachments that can be scewed in here.

---

Team Blacksheep:

US$6 - Ethix Battery Straps (4pcs) - 250mm
US$6 - Ethix Battery Straps V2 (4pcs) - 230mm
US$4 - XT60 pigtail (16awg)

The Team Blacksheep web shop is extremely basic - e.g. there appears to be no account details page and no ability to see outstanding orders (but you do get a link in your confirmation email that allows you to see the status of your order).

I was interested to compare the feel of the 16AWG pigtail with the more usual 12AWG ones.

If I could have, I would have gotten these parts via GetFPV but they were unavailable or out of stock.

Shipping took from May 29th to June 19th and it came in a padded envelope.

Digitec.ch

Fr. 104 - ToolkitRC P200 mini-desktop power suppy
Fr. 10.80 - 3 x XT60+ connector pair

I bought the P200 from a local supplier because ToolkitRC has such a poor QA reputation that I wanted to be able to return it easily if necessary.

You can upgade the firmware as described here: <https://oscarliang.com/toolkitrc-p200/>

The delivered P200 came with the latest firmware (as the last update - 1.05 - came out in July 2021, that's hardly surprising).

The XT60+ connectors actually appear to be genuine Amass XT60H connectors (that are packed and sold by Muldental). This is surprising - even the XT60 on the pigtail I got from TBS is unbranded.

---

Digitec.ch 2nd order:

Fr. 11.60 XT60 female to female cable  <https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/ep-adapterkabel-xt60-fem-auf-xt60-fem-rc-kabel-stecker-12011982>

This cable can be used with the HOTA charger to use it as a bench powersupply.

I bought this after discharging one of my LiPo batteries beyond the point of no return while setting up the quad.

This cable is manufactured by EP: <https://www.epproduct.com/de/adapterkabel/20346-ep-adapterkabel-xt60-fem-auf-xt60-fem-7613081055215.html>
It seems readily available in Europe.
But I couldn't find an equivalent on GetFPV or RDQ.
But you can find something similar on AliExpress:

* <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002863876048.html>
* <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003890494615.html>
* <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003396022942.html>

You want the female head to female head variant.

They don't have many sales but I had a good experience with the JST-XH extension cables from this store and they do the XH60 in the nicer XT60H variant: <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005813809579.html>

Caddx FPV

US$150 - Walksnail Avatar HD Kit V2 (with Gyroflow + 32GB)

I don't imagine, I'll use Gyroflow but at $10 extra it seemed a minimal extra cost compared to everything else.

Standard shipping was US$10.

NOTE: I'd like to know what the current draw is at 9V given that my FC is the 2.1 version that supports max 1.5A (vs the 3A of the 2.2 version).

Shipping took from June 18th until July 1st. Came in a cardboard box with bubblewrap (the box was to small that the kit could be surrounded by bubblewrap on all sides but the box contents are well padded themselves). Oddly, Caddx underdeclared the value of the shippment, reporting it as US$15 rather than US$150. This seems to be standard practice for AliExpress stores but surprised me for a firm like Caddx.

**Important:** see note about aspect ratio and goggles in README.

GetFPV

Purchasing from GetFPV makes most sense if you try and buy all items from them - I did the opposite and paid a huge US$80 for shipping for essentially a pair of goggles and a frame that I could have got locally for a far lower shipping cost and no import duty.

US$0.70 - Neoprene Landing Pads (4 Pack)
US$14.30 - VIFLY ShortSaver 2
US$2.20 - Diatone Mamba Interference Isolation Board V2
US$2.20 - Diatone Mamba Practice Soldering Board V2
US$3 - iFlight BLITZ Practice Soldering Board
US$3 - HQProp 5.1X2.5X3 3-Blade Propeller (Set of 4) (I bought 2 packs, i.e. 8 props altogether, for a total of $6)
US$5 - Ummagrip Universal Sticky Battery Pad (3mm thick)
US$5 - Ummagrip Lite Universal Sticky Battery pad (1.5mm thick)
US$8 - Lumenier Indestructible Kevlar Lipo Strap - 20x250mm (3pcs)
US$4.40 - Holybro Pixhawk Foam Pads (20pcs)
US$13 - EV-Peak CellMeter-7 Battery Capacity Checker
US$75 - Lumenier QAV-R 2 Deadcat Freestyle Quadcopter Frame - 6" variant
US$280 - Fat Shark Recon HD FPV Goggles
US$17.60 - Ethix Quad-Builder Cable Set
US$2 - Panasonic 35V 1000uF LOW ESR Capacitor (I bought four for a total of $8)

Shipping was US$80 (and that was the cheapest option available).

The package was about 250x210x170mm and less than 1.7kg - so, US$80 feels like a lot for such a small parcel.

But it arrived in 5 days and was well packed (cardboard box and suitable packing material).

Import duties were CHF54.80 (23.70 of which was DHL's fee for handling import duties).

Note: the Lumenier QAV-R 2 turned out to include Neoprene Landing Pads so buying them separately was rather redundant.

Note: it was very non-obvious (to me) how to open the Ethix cable set box without tearing apart - of course, it's easy once you know how - see the 2m 55s mark in Mr. Steele's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAjfHulJmss&t=175s) on the product. See note in README for what AWG to use for what job.

SD card - the Recon HD goggles don't come with an SD card and you'll need one if you want to upgrade the firmware or record the received video.

The cheapest SD cards these days are class 10 U1 cards. But you should go for a U3 card (which will be more than adaquate for this purpose - there's no need for anything higher end).

A 32GB _SanDisk Extreme U3 V30 A1_ costs around US$10. There's no point buying a larger card as Fatshark googles typically work best with FAT32 which doesn't support more than 32GB.

Any U3 card will be more than capable 

---

I put the GetFPV order together after the FeiYing one, if doing again, I'd buy the battery checker from FeiYing for 1/4 the price.

See note about CellMeter-7 and 8 in README.

Wings RC store

US$12.40 - 12 pairs Gemfan 51466 V2 props
US$13.30 - 12 pairs DALPROP CYCLONE T5045C PRO props

Shipping was free.

Shipping took from June 9th to June 21st and came in a large padded envelope. This was one of the fastest shipping time for anything I got from China.

Conrad

I bought 3 different thicknesses of cable tie:

Fr. 1.20 - 1577930 NYLON CABLE TIES 2.0 X 120 MM SW 100STK
Fr. 1.20 - 1577934 NYLON CABLE TIES 2.2 X 150 MM SW 100STK
Fr. 1.85 - 1577948 NYLON CABLE TIES 2.5 X 200 MM SW 100STK

Shipping took a few days. Shipping was Fr. 9 and there was a Fr. 5 small-order surcharge.

Mitoot AliExpress store:

US$8.20 - Radiomaster radio transmitter neck strap
US$2.30 - 5V WS2812B LED tail light integrated with buzzer

Shipping was US$1.50

Shipping took from June 19th to 28th and came in a padded envelope. This was the fastest shipping time for anything I got from China.

Seconds order:

US$20.50 - AOKoda 150W discharger/balancer

Shipping was $0.90.

Shipping took from June 24th until July 5th - came in padded envelope with additional padding (unfortunately, despite this the platic case for the unit was a little cracked).

---

VIFLY:

US$28 - 2 x VIFLY StoreSafe - LiPo Battery Discharger (2 packs each containing 2 dischargers, i.e. 4 in total)

Shipping was free.

Note: if I'd bought the VIFLY smoke stopper here rather than at GetFPV, it would have been US$1.30 cheaper.

Shipping took from Jun 24th until July 10th and came in a padded envelope.

---

OOTDTY Consumer Electronics AliExpress store:

US$1.40 2 x 9V USB-C to 5.5x2.1mm adapter
US$1.20 1m 9V USB-C to 5.5x2.1mm cable

Shipping was US$1.50

Shipping took from June 27th to July 8th and came in a thin plastic shipping bag.

---

Speeding and Running Digital Store AliExpress store:

US$1.30 2 x 9V USB-C to 5.5x2.1mm adapter
US$1.15 1m 9V USB-C to 5.5x2.1mm cable

Shipping was US$1.60

Shipping took from June 27th to July 8th and came in a thin plastic shipping bag.

Note: I bought this from both OOTDTY (above) and "Speeding and Running Digital" as OOTDTY's store hasn't existed long (and is very poorly setup - e.g. for the adapters, it's often hard to determine what particular variant of a product you need to select, e.g. 5.5x2.1mm is just shown as 5521). The Speeding store has existed longer and shipped more of the given items.

In the end, both packages arrived on exactly the same day and were identical. The one from Speeding was slightly scuffed but I suspect that was bad luck during shipping rather than anything else.

**Update:** the ones from Speeding were plain 5V right-angle adapters, i.e. no e-mark chip, so _not what was ordered_.

I'd read in some reviews that the cables were lower quality than shown in the pictures (and that's why I also ordered the adapters - in case the cables were terrible quality). But the cables seem good quality (perhaps people were comparing against the perfect computer renders used in the pictures).

The cables and adapters come with the same style QR code stickers so, I suspect both are from the same manufacturer. And I'm moderately confident OOTDTY is the manufacturer of the adapters.

I tested both the cable and the adapter with a USB-C power adapter (capable of 9V) and both output exactly 9V with the inside of the jack, in both cases, being positive.

Note: when referring to barrel jacks, the term _positive polarity_ means _center_ positive.

From a little research, it _seems_ center positive is becoming the norm these days - but center negative was once common in certain domains.

The Recon HD goggles expect center positive.

FPVKING Store:

US$34 - Matek M10Q-5883 GPS and compass

Shipping was US$1.60 (the default was free but I selected the next option up as it said this would reduce shipping time by 1 week).

Shipping took from June 28th to July 8th and came in a padded envelope.

---

Reichelt:

EUR2.70 2 x FK-A 35V 1000uF capacitor - EEUFK1V102S - (EUR1.35 each)
EUR14 Loctite 243 - blue thread locker
EUR5.30 - welders gloves (single size)
EUR2.80 - TESA extra power cloth tape (19mm x 2.75m) - gaffer tape

Plus miscellaneous other items - shipping was EUR10.

**Decision:** what to use - some people use tape (Chris Rosser mocks JB for using red electrical tape), some people use clear heat shrink and some use cable ties to secure the wires to the arms.

thanksforyou Store: US$13.50 + US1.85 postage - 8x1 pogopin testing jig - ordered June 21st, arrived July 5th - in padded envelope with additional bubble wrap.
omumao Store: $US19.50 + free shipping - 3x1 and 5x1 pogopin testing jig - ordered June 21st, arrived July 5th - in cardboard box with bubble wrap.
Hennybig Fish Store: US$18.40 + US$2.40 postage - 2x1 and 4x1 pogopin testing jig - ordered June 21st, arrived July 5th - in cardboard box with bubble wrap.

The jigs from omumao and Hennybig Fish seem to be from the same manufacturer but of course there's no idenitifying branding.

GensACE:

EUR78 - 3 x 2200mAh 75C 4S1P Lipo with XT60 - TAA22004S75X6 (EUR26 each)
EUR7.70 - Soaring Mini 2200mAh 20C 2S1P Lipo with XT60 - GEA222S20X6GT

I would have bought the non-G-Tech version of the Soaring Mini (with SKU GEA22002S20X6) but it was out of stock (they're the same price but why buy G-Tech batteries if you don't/can't use the G-Tech feature).

Shipping was EUR32.70 (for some reason, you could also opt for a far more expensive "dangerous goods" shipping option - I did not and couldn't see an explanation for when or why one should).

Import duties were CHF33.50  (24.50 of which was UPS's fee for handling import duties).

Helifree.ch

CFF4 - BetaFPV M2 screws and rubber dampers
CF8 - Flywoo 20x20mm insulation board (10 pieces)
CF8.40 - Flywoo 30x30mm insulation board (10 pieces)

Shipping was CHF7

If buying again, I'd get the BetaFPV item as part of my BetaFPV order. And I _might_ get the clear GepRC insulation boards rather than the Flywoo ones.

GBP57 - Tekko32 F4 4in1 50A
GBP2.60 - 8 x M3 lock nuts (black)
GBP4 - Holybro long and short 8 Pin JST-SH ribbon cables for ESC
GBP1.60 - 8 Pin JST-SH male plug with 200mm silicone wire pigtail

I suspect I thought the 200mm cable had a plug on both ends but it was just a pigtail.

The ESC was version 1.7 - the same as the one bought via Banggood.

Oddly, M3 lock nuts seem are only available in plain steel color (and seem to be permanently out of stock) at GetFPV - <https://www.getfpv.com/m3-nylock-nut-set-of-16.html> (the also have M3 press nuts and M3 nylon nuts - these are _not_ lock nuts). RDQ have them - <https://www.racedayquads.com/products/m3-nylock-nut-choose-your-color>

From AliExpress:

* <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33034833428.html>

Outside the US, you can obviously buy M3 lock nuts in any hardware store (though just in plain steel color and only in normal height rather than the low-profile format stocked by some FPV stores).

Would have bought but didn't:

* Diatone M2 o-rings: <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001264267019.html>

Actually, the BetaFPV rubber dampers (above) turned out to be the perfect thing - needed for mounting the Flywoo insulation board above the VTX. Anything larger than the BetaFPV ones wouldn't have worked - on the Diatone M2 o-ring page they also have M2 dampers but they look too tall.

Oddly, the QAV R-2 didn't come with any nuts.

The VTX really did start to overheat even in standby mode when working with it on my desk. I ordered something similar to what JB recommends in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8ztDFvQt88).

Fans are generally 12V so, powering them via 5V USB will mean you're getting less power from them than they can deliver (however, it's probably still more than enough).

I ordered two versions:

* US$20.15 Sensda Electronics - a version with a 12V wall power adapter - <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32626023064.html> (shipping was free)
* US$6.50 Gdstime Technology - a simple 5V USB version - <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32684380486.html> (shipping wsa US$4)

Note: Gdstime seem to be the producers of the fans that are sold on many other AliExpress stores, they have high sales for other fans - the particular one I chose had no previous sales but it was the size I wanted (the higher sales ones were larger 120mm fans - I wanted a smaller 75mm one).

I don't think I noticed at the time how big the price difference was between the two.

Shipping for the Sensda one was from Aug 5th to Aug 15th (making it among the fastest deliveries) and was well packed in a cardboard box. The fan is ludicruously over powered for my needs - at full power, it pumps out way air than I would have imagined possible for such a smaall device - this means there's only a tiny portion at the start of the speed dial that's useful (above that it starts to push itself and other things around) - this makes it fiddly to get a suitable speed. Adding the provided funnel just makes the situation more extreme. The funnel is not designed to stay in place without glue. The fan picks up speed very slowly - it takes several seconds to get going but once it does it really goes. This is clearly a fan that could keep a substantial server cool - it's overkill for a tiny VTX. It's nice that it's speed adjustable but the useable range for my setup is so small as make this aspect less useful. There's only a few degrees on the dial where the fan goes slowly enough not to be overwhelming so, there's limited value to the ability to control the speed - it's basically got three modes: off, in the extremely small range where it's useable or going way too fast.

The Sensda fan is 95mm and already feels quite big - I don't see any point in going for the larger 120mm fans, that seem to be the most popular size on AliExpress, for this purpose.

The Gdstime fan is 75mm - they also have:

Shipping for the Gdstime one took from Aug 6 to Aug 18th. It came in a padded envelope with additional padding and cardboard to protect it, i.e. very well packed.

20mm smaller than the Sensda one, this makes all the difference - it feels far more mini but produces enough airflow (while being nothing close to the hurricane that the Sensda produces). It's designed for 5V and draws 0.4A (I checked with a voltage/current tester) so, it can reasonably be powered from a laptop USB port. It's not particurly quiet and, unlike the Sensda, the speed isn't controllable. The Sensda fan feels very substantial (and you could imagine it working away for years in a server). The Gdstime one is much less substantial but is still reasonable quality and I'd take it over the cheap novelty USB fans that you can find on many online electronic stores.

* 60mm - <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32834229283.html>
* 50mm - <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32687304125.html>

TODO: see how much current the USB draws - is it more than 500mW that old style laptop USB-A connectors provided?

U-Angle-1988 AliExpress store

US$2.35 - 20cm JST-XH balance lead extension cable (5 pieces)

Shipping was US$3.75 as I wanted faster shipping but the default was US$0.35.

Shipping took from Aug 7th to Aug 16th and came is padded envelope.

BUT the connectors weren't genuine JST-XH connectors (or good fakes) - they were slightly too high and more importantly the holes were holes were slightly too small and set slightly too high and so the female connectors couldn't be inserted in my charger.

AEROPS UAV AliExpress store

US$2.80 - 10cm JST-XH balance lead extension cable (4 pieces)

Shipping was US$1.70

Shipping took from Aug 16th to Sept 6th and came in a padded envelope.

They had the same issue as the U-Angle-1988 ones.

DeKuSi Electron AliExpress store

US$2.80 - 10cm JST-XH balance lead extension cable (4 pieces)

Shipping was US$6.30, i.e. pretty expensive by AliExpress standards.

Shipping took from Aug 16th to Aug 28th and came in a well padded bag.

Unlike the U-Angle-1988 ones, they fit as expected. Note detaching the battery's balance connector from these extension leads isn't as nice/easy as detaching them directly from the charger.

FPV24.com

EUR2.44 - iFlight M3 rubber damper balls for FPV F4 F7 FC (20 pieces)
EUR3.28 - Mateksys FC vibration damping M3*7+4.5 (4 pieces)

GetFPV have the same products:

* <https://www.getfpv.com/anti-vibration-flight-controller-standoff-7mm.html>
* <https://www.getfpv.com/iflight-m3-rubber-damper-balls-for-f4-f7-flight-controller-20-pcs.html><

Shipping was EUR11.68 and came in a few days (from Germany).

Surprisingly, the products look to really be iFlight and Mateksys branded products.

The iFlight grommets are somewhat longer on one side than the other (they're half-way between the ones that came from Holybro and the ones below from FlightOne).

FPVracing.ch

CH3.50 - Soft mount grommet (black, 5 pieces)
CHF3.90 - M3 Aluminium lock nut (green, 4 pieces)
CHF3.90 - M3 multipurpose o-ring (8 pieces)

The o-rings are from Lumenier and also available from GetFPV - <https://www.getfpv.com/multipurpose-o-ring-set-of-8.html>

Shipping was CHF5 and came in a few days.

The grommets are perfect - unlike the iFlight ones they're equally long on both sides. However, they come from a company - FlightOne - that according to JB is [dead or should be dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqtlnPCbMM).

Actually, my intention was to add an o-ring under the grommet - so perhaps the iFlight ones are ideal and I can avoid the an o-ring.

Hagibis Offical store

US$17.70 60Hz HDMI to USB-C capture device

Shipping was US$2.50

Check if works with https://obsproject.com/> and see if OBS Studio can display details about the capture hardware - is it really using an MS2130?

Shipping took from 10th Aug to 22 Aug and arrived in a thin plastic bag with no additional padding beyond the devices retail packaging lightweight cardboard box.

It worked perfectly with [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), though I could see any obvious way to display details about the capture hardware to confirm it was using an MS2130 - but whether it does or not, it worked perfectly for capturing output from the goggles (via the HDMI adapter that I already had).
