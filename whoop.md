Whoops
======

You can build up to a 5" from a whoop - these have prop guards and the dangers of things breaking when you crash (and the cost if they do) is less.

Cinewhoops are definitely supposed to be easier to fly than a 5" (their design and rates are generally for easy cruising rather than crazy stunts).

Tiny whoops seem to be a bit more manic - they're the 5" quads smaller brother - but like a 5", you can adjust the rates etc. to be more suitable for a beginner.

Low cost cinewhoop and tiny whoop options that come with Walksnail video:

* Cinewhoop: DarwinFPV CineApe 25 - <https://darwinfpv.com/products/darwinfpv-cineape-25-cinematic-whoop-fpv-drone>
* Tiny whoop: Meteor75 Pro - <https://betafpv.com/products/meteor75-pro-brushless-whoop-quadcopter-1s-hd-digital-vtx>

The Meteor75 Pro actually has an 80mm wheelbase (rather than the 75mm it's name might suggest) frame.

The DarwinFPV CineApe 25 has a 2.5" propellers and a wheelbase of 112mm.

80mm seems to be considered at the upper end size-wise for indoor flying but (as Nick Burns's video shows) it's perfectly possible to fly the DarwinFPV CineApe 25 indoors.

The Cinewhoop is meant to flown with something like a GoPro (or the much cheaper Caddx Walnut) in addition to the FPV camera. Given that a Walksnail camera records locally as well as transmitting, it's questionably how much value this has unless you want really high-end footage.

The DarwinFPV CineAPE 25 does though take much larger batteries and so can fly for longer.

The Meteor75 Pro takes 1S batteries and unlike the larger multicell batteries can't be plugged into your normal balance charger.

Up until recently, it's been hard to get 1S batteries to storage voltage. But as NordFPV points out (in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVJa6Y9Y-ag), there are now some nice solutions.

I'd go with the Vifly Whoopstor - <https://viflydrone.com/collections/lipro-battery-charger>
